# Stroke Prediction Statistical Analysis

## Project Status
Active

## Project Intro / Objective
This project is part of the **AAI-500-02 course** in the Applied Artificial Intelligence program at the University of San Diego.  

Our goal is to perform an **end-to-end statistical analysis** on the Kaggle Stroke Prediction Dataset.  
We focus on hypothesis testing (e.g., age effect, hypertension effect, BMI differences) and compare traditional statistical methods with a machine learning model for validation.

## Project Description
We analyze the **Stroke Prediction Dataset** (Kaggle, by Fedesoriano).  

- **Size:** ~5,000 rows Ã— 12 features  
- **Variables include:** age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, glucose level, smoking status, marital status, residence type, etc.  
- **Target:** stroke (0 = No, 1 = Yes)  

**Hypotheses to Explore:**
1. Older age increases the odds of stroke.  
2. Hypertension remains a significant predictor of stroke after adjusting for age and BMI.  
3. Mean BMI differs between stroke and non-stroke groups.  
 

**Analysis Plan:**
- Clean and prepare data (handle missing BMI values, encode categorical features).  
- Conduct statistical hypothesis testing (t-tests, chi-square tests, logistic regression).  
- Compare logistic regression performance with a machine learning model (Random Forest for example).  
- Report results with confidence intervals, p-values, and AUC scores.
